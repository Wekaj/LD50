Your control grows smaller everyday. The body count is increasing and the police are cracking down harder than ever.

At this rate, your lieutenants will be your prison cellmates and your crime family history will end with you.

The stress is piling up and your patience is running short.

A familiar voice calls out. The unknown entity looms over you, standing in the same corner it last spoke to you from.

'all is not lost, for i bring your family a chance at salvation'

You are hesitant but entertain it's proposal. 

'all the power you need is held within tome.' Before you can ask any questions, you fall back into a deep slumber.
