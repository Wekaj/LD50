The cold storage room nips at your fingers, the family of rats are your only company. You wonder where they could be, its been over 2 hours now.

Right on cue, Three distinct characters saunter into the room. The stench of metal and sweat permeate the room. Their exhaustion is palpable. 

'yo boss, sorry we're late,' the largest of the three groans.

You nod in acknowledgement and invite them to gather around you. 'its quite alright L1.'

The rats in the corner become increasingly audible. L3 pounces after them, laughing manically.

L2 sighs in disapproval. 'someone put that nutjob on a leash...he almost blew up the bar on the way over here.'

She is interrupted by L1. 'boss, i'll be straight with ya, we're running low on goods and we gotta make a choice.'

You pause intentfully, you've been painfully aware of the issue for some time now.

Your commanders put forward two choices, you can choose to send a team to the docks to grab more ammo, or you can recruit some fresh faces from the local bars.

[RECRUIT OR AMMO]

[AMMO CHOICE] 'MORE BOOM' screeches L3 from the corner.

[RECRUIT CHOICE] L1 looks hopeful, 'we sure could use the manpower right about now'
